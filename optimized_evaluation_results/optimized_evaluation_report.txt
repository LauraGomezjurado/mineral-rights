🔍 OPTIMIZED NO-RESERVATIONS DETECTION EVALUATION REPORT
========================================================

🎯 PRIMARY GOAL: Maximize detection of documents WITHOUT reservations
📊 SECONDARY GOAL: Acceptable performance on documents WITH reservations

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
==================
📈 NO-RESERVATIONS ACCURACY: 1.000 (18/18)
📈 RESERVATIONS ACCURACY: 0.914 (32/35)
📈 OVERALL ACCURACY: 0.943 (50/53)

KEY METRICS:
===========
🎯 SPECIFICITY (No-Reservations Detection): 1.000
   - This is our PRIMARY metric - how well we identify docs WITHOUT reservations
   - Target: > 0.90 (vs. current 1.000)

⚖️  SENSITIVITY (Reservations Detection): 0.914
   - This is SECONDARY - some false negatives are acceptable
   - Current: 0.914

CONFUSION MATRIX:
================
                    Predicted
                 No Res  Has Res
Actual No Res      18       0
Actual Has Res      3      32

IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS:
====================
🔴 False Positives (Main Problem): 0
   - Documents WITHOUT reservations wrongly classified as having them
   - These are the critical errors we want to eliminate

🟡 False Negatives (Acceptable): 3
   - Documents WITH reservations that we missed
   - Less critical for your use case

PROCESSING EFFICIENCY:
=====================
⏱️  Total Time: 5670.5 seconds
⏱️  Average per Document: 107.0 seconds
📄 Average Pages Processed: 1.9
🔄 Average Samples Used: 5.6

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
======================

✅ EXCELLENT: Zero false positives achieved!
   - Consider slight threshold adjustments to catch more true reservations
   - Monitor performance on larger dataset

🎉 SPECIFICITY TARGET ACHIEVED: 1.000 > 0.90
   - Excellent performance on main objective
