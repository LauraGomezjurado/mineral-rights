🔍 OPTIMIZED NO-RESERVATIONS DETECTION EVALUATION REPORT
========================================================

🎯 PRIMARY GOAL: Maximize detection of documents WITHOUT reservations
📊 SECONDARY GOAL: Acceptable performance on documents WITH reservations

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
==================
📈 NO-RESERVATIONS ACCURACY: 0.667 (18/27)
📈 RESERVATIONS ACCURACY: 0.154 (4/26)
📈 OVERALL ACCURACY: 0.415 (22/53)

KEY METRICS:
===========
🎯 SPECIFICITY (No-Reservations Detection): 0.667
   - This is our PRIMARY metric - how well we identify docs WITHOUT reservations
   - Target: > 0.90 (vs. current 0.667)

⚖️  SENSITIVITY (Reservations Detection): 0.154
   - This is SECONDARY - some false negatives are acceptable
   - Current: 0.154

CONFUSION MATRIX:
================
                    Predicted
                 No Res  Has Res
Actual No Res      18       9
Actual Has Res     22       4

IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS:
====================
🔴 False Positives (Main Problem): 9
   - Documents WITHOUT reservations wrongly classified as having them
   - These are the critical errors we want to eliminate

🟡 False Negatives (Acceptable): 22
   - Documents WITH reservations that we missed
   - Less critical for your use case

PROCESSING EFFICIENCY:
=====================
⏱️  Total Time: 2651.6 seconds
⏱️  Average per Document: 50.0 seconds
📄 Average Pages Processed: 2.3
🔄 Average Samples Used: 3.1

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
======================

🔧 PRIORITY: Reduce 9 false positives
   1. Analyze the 9 documents wrongly classified as having reservations
   2. Identify common patterns in boilerplate language being misclassified
   3. Enhance prompt with specific examples from these false positives
   4. Consider raising confidence threshold for positive classifications

📈 SPECIFICITY IMPROVEMENT NEEDED:
   - Current: 0.667, Target: > 0.90
   - Focus on conservative classification strategies
   - Enhance boilerplate detection patterns
