###  **Step 1: Sample N contrastive responses from an LLM**

* Prompt your LLM N times with temperature > 0 to get *diverse outputs*.
* Each response contains:

  * A **classification** (e.g. "has reservations" = 1 or "no reservations" = 0)
  * A **reasoning trace** (optional but useful for feature extraction)



###  **Step 2: For each sample**

#### → **Get a classification** (0 or 1)


* Use regex/parsing rules (e.g. look for `"no reservation"` vs `"reservation noted"`).


#### → **Walk through the logic**

Highlight:

* Which phrases led the model to infer a reservation?
* Did the model cite anything factual, speculative, or vague?

<!-- This is **qualitative** for interpretability, but you can make it **quantitative** with features.

### **→ Compute a Confidence Score via Logistic Regression**

 **7 lightweight feature ideas** adapted from RASC and tailored to a classification task:

| Feature                       | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **F1. Sentence Count**        | Longer reasoning is often more reliable.                                          |
| **F2. Trigger Word Presence** | Does the output contain words like `"concern"`, `"but"`, `"issue"`? (for class 1) |
| **F3. Lexical Consistency**   | Jaccard similarity between input and output — more overlap may mean coherence.    |
| **F4. Format Validity**       | Did the LLM follow the requested output format (e.g., `"Answer: ..."`) correctly? |
| **F5. Answer Certainty**      | Count of hedging words: *might*, *probably*, *unclear* → high = low confidence    |
| **F6. Model Logit Gap**       | If you have access: gap between top 2 logits. Higher gap = higher confidence      |
| **F7. Past Agreement**        | Similarity to previous high-confidence samples (semantic or lexical)              |

### **→ Add Its Weighted Vote to a Running Total**

```python
# Example
votes = {0: 0.0, 1: 0.0}
votes[predicted_class] += confidence_score
```

This builds a **soft voting ensemble**, where each sample’s weight is its confidence.



###  **Early Stopping Check**

After each vote:

```python
total = sum(votes.values())
top_class = max(votes, key=votes.get)

if votes[top_class] / total >= τ:
    return top_class
```
